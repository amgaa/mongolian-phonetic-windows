The keyboard hook has been fixed. The issue was that SendInput was being called
from inside the keyboard hook callback, which caused synchronization issues.

Changes made:
1. Added async text sending using Task.Run()
2. Added _isSending flag to prevent processing our own injected keys
3. Added small delays between operations for reliability

Please rebuild the application:
1. Close the running application
2. Run: .\build.ps1
3. Start the new executable: .\publish\MongolianPhonetic.exe
4. Test typing in Notepad

If characters still don't appear, try running as Administrator.
