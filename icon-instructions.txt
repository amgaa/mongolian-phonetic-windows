ICON FILE INSTRUCTIONS
======================

The application will generate a basic icon at runtime, but for a better-looking
installer and application icon, you should create an icon file.

To create icon.ico:

Option 1: Use an online converter
----------------------------------
1. Create a 256x256 PNG image with your desired icon design
2. Use an online ICO converter like:
   - https://www.icoconverter.com/
   - https://convertio.co/png-ico/
3. Save the result as "icon.ico" in this directory

Option 2: Use GIMP (Free)
--------------------------
1. Create your icon design at 256x256 pixels
2. Go to File → Export As
3. Save as "icon.ico"
4. Select all the sizes you want to include (16, 32, 48, 256)

Option 3: Use professional icon editor
---------------------------------------
- IcoFX (Windows) - https://icofx.ro/
- Axialis IconWorkshop (Windows) - https://www.axialis.com/
- IconFly (macOS) - https://www.iconfactory.com/

Recommended icon design:
- Show Mongolian script (ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ) or Cyrillic "Мон"
- Use blue/red/yellow colors (Mongolian flag colors)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

Once you have icon.ico, the build process will automatically include it in:
- The executable (visible in Task Manager, File Explorer, etc.)
- The installer
- The system tray (though the app generates its own tray icon at runtime)
